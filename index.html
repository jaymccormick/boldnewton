        In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or
        continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.
      </li>
      <li>
         	In an inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the forces F on an
          object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the
          acceleration a of the object: F = ma.
      </li>
      <li>
        When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body
        simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in
        direction on the first body.
